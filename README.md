# MCEF (Minecraft Chromium Embedded Framework)
MCEF is a mod and library for adding the Chromium web browser into Minecraft.

MCEF is based on java-cef (Java Chromium Embedded Framework), which is based on CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework), which is based on Chromium. It was originally created by montoyo. It was rewritten and currently maintained by the CinemaMod Group.

MCEF contains a downloader system for downloading the java-cef & CEF binaries required by the Chromium browser. This requires a connection to https://mcef-download.cinemamod.com.

### Building & Modifying MCEF
After cloning this repo, you will need to clone the java-cef git submodule. There is a gradle task for this: `./gradlew cloneJcef`.

To run the Fabric client: `./gradlew fabricClient`
To run the Forge client: `./gradlew forgeClient`

In-game, there is a demo browser if you press F10 after you're loaded into a world (the demo browser only exists when you're running from a development environment).
